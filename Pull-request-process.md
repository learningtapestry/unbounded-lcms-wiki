## Creating a Pull Request

Thank you for deciding to contribute! Before you create a pull request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/learningtapestry/unbounded-lcms/issues) so that the maintainers have a chance to review and discuss your suggestion. Prefer to chat instead? Feel free to post your question in the [project gitter chat](https://gitter.im/learningtapestry/unbounded-lcms).

When you create a pull request, please note whether it is a bug or an enhancement and reference the issue id (use `fixes #` syntax) so that we can track your PR to the issue. Please do add tests for your proposed change, and ensure tests pass locally before submitting your PR.

In the Pull Request include a description of what you are changing, and any manual steps needed to verify the code. Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request if you are able to do so. It will help us greatly when we review your PR.

## Special Considerations

*This section only applies to maintainers who are making PRs from the original UnboundEd project*

When submitting a PR to this repo based on code from the UnboundEd repo, please be sure to squash your commits and remove the issue IDs from the original commit messages, since they will not be relevant here.
